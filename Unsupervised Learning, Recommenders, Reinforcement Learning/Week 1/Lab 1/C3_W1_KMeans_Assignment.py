# * You will start with a sample dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works.

# ## 1 - Implementing K-means
# 
# The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar
# data points together. 
# 
# * Concretely, you are given a training set $\{x^{(1)}, ..., x^{(m)}\}$, and you want
# to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”. 
# 
# 
# * K-means is an iterative procedure that
#      * Starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then 
#      * Refines this guess by 
#          * Repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids, and then 
#          * Recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.
#          
# 
# * In pseudocode, the K-means algorithm is as follows:
# 
#     ``` python
#     # Initialize centroids
#     # K is the number of clusters
#     centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)
#     
#     for iter in range(iterations):
#         # Cluster assignment step: 
#         # Assign each data point to the closest centroid. 
#         # idx[i] corresponds to the index of the centroid 
#         # assigned to example i
#         idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)
# 
#         # Move centroid step: 
#         # Compute means based on centroid assignments
#         centroids = compute_centroids(X, idx, K)
#     ```
# 
# 
# * The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: 
#     1. Assigning each training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, and
#     2. Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. 
#     
#     
# * The $K$-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. 
# 
# * However, the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids.
#     * Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. 
#     * One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).
# 
# You will implement the two phases of the K-means algorithm separately
# in the next sections. 
# * You will start by completing `find_closest_centroid` and then proceed to complete `compute_centroids`.

# <a name="1.1"></a>
# ### 1.1 Finding closest centroids
# 
# In the “cluster assignment” phase of the K-means algorithm, the
# algorithm assigns every training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest
# centroid, given the current positions of centroids. 
# 
# <a name="ex01"></a>
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# Your task is to complete the code in `find_closest_centroids`. 
# * This function takes the data matrix `X` and the locations of all
# centroids inside `centroids` 
# * It should output a one-dimensional array `idx` (which has the same number of elements as `X`) that holds the index  of the closest centroid (a value in $\{0,...,K-1\}$, where $K$ is total number of centroids) to every training example . *(Note: The index range 0 to K-1 varies slightly from what is shown in the lectures (i.e. 1 to K) because Python list indices start at 0 instead of 1)*
# * Specifically, for every example $x^{(i)}$ we set
# $$c^{(i)} := j \quad \mathrm{that \; minimizes} \quad ||x^{(i)} - \mu_j||^2,$$
# where 
#  * $c^{(i)}$ is the index of the centroid that is closest to $x^{(i)}$ (corresponds to `idx[i]` in the starter code), and 
#  * $\mu_j$ is the position (value) of the $j$’th centroid. (stored in `centroids` in the starter code)
#  * $||x^{(i)} - \mu_j||$ is the L2-norm
#

# ### 1.2 Computing centroid means
# 
# Given assignments of every point to a centroid, the second phase of the
# algorithm recomputes, for each centroid, the mean of the points that
# were assigned to it.
# 
# 
# <a name="ex02"></a>
# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Please complete the `compute_centroids` below to recompute the value for each centroid
# 
# * Specifically, for every centroid $\mu_k$ we set
# $$\mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{i \in C_k} x^{(i)}$$ 
# 
#     where 
#     * $C_k$ is the set of examples that are assigned to centroid $k$
#     * $|C_k|$ is the number of examples in the set $C_k$
# 
# 
# * Concretely, if two examples say $x^{(3)}$ and $x^{(5)}$ are assigned to centroid $k=2$,
# then you should update $\mu_2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^{(3)}+x^{(5)})$.

# ## 4 - Image compression with K-means
# 
# In this exercise, you will apply K-means to image compression. 
# 
# * In a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image$^{2}$, each pixel is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green and blue intensity values. This encoding is often refered to as the RGB encoding.
# * Our image contains thousands of colors, and in this part of the exercise, you will reduce the number of
# colors to 16 colors.
# * By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an efficient way. 
# * Specifically, you only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image you now need to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities).
# 
# In this part, you will use the K-means algorithm to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image.
# * Concretely, you will treat every pixel in the original image as a data example and use the K-means algorithm to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3- dimensional RGB space.
# * Once you have computed the cluster centroids on the image, you will then use the 16 colors to replace the pixels in the original image.

# ### 4.1 Dataset
# 
# **Load image**
# 
# First, you will use `matplotlib` to read in the original image, as shown below.

# In[46]:


# Load an image of a bird
original_img = plt.imread('bird_small.png')


# **Visualize image**
# 
# You can visualize the image that was just loaded using the code below.

# In[47]:


# Visualizing the image
plt.imshow(original_img)


# **Check the dimension of the variable**
# 
# As always, you will print out the shape of your variable to get more familiar with the data.

# In[48]:


print("Shape of original_img is:", original_img.shape)


# As you can see, this creates a three-dimensional matrix `original_img` where 
# * the first two indices identify a pixel position, and
# * the third index represents red, green, or blue. 
# 
# For example, `original_img[50, 33, 2]` gives the blue intensity of the pixel at row 50 and column 33.
# 
# #### Processing data
# 
# To call the `run_kMeans`, you need to first transform the matrix `original_img` into a two-dimensional matrix.
# 
# * The code below reshapes the matrix `original_img` to create an $m \times 3$ matrix of pixel colors (where
# $m=16384 = 128\times128$)
# 
# *Note: If you'll try this exercise later on a JPG file, you first need to divide the pixel values by 255 so it will be in the range 0 to 1. This is not necessary for PNG files (e.g. `bird_small.png`) because it is already loaded in the required range (as mentioned in the [plt.imread() documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imread.html)). We commented a line below for this so you can just uncomment it later in case you want to try a different file.* 

# In[49]:


# Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1 (not needed for PNG files)
# original_img = original_img / 255

# Reshape the image into an m x 3 matrix where m = number of pixels
# (in this case m = 128 x 128 = 16384)
# Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
# This gives us our dataset matrix X_img that we will use K-Means on.

X_img = np.reshape(original_img, (original_img.shape[0] * original_img.shape[1], 3))


# <a name="4.2"></a>
# ### 4.2 K-Means on image pixels
# 
# Now, run the cell below to run K-Means on the pre-processed image.

# In[50]:


# Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
# You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 16
max_iters = 10

# Using the function you have implemented above. 
initial_centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X_img, K)

# Run K-Means - this can take a couple of minutes depending on K and max_iters
centroids, idx = run_kMeans(X_img, initial_centroids, max_iters)


# In[51]:


print("Shape of idx:", idx.shape)
print("Closest centroid for the first five elements:", idx[:5])


# The code below will plot all the colors found in the original image. As mentioned earlier, the color of each pixel is represented by RGB values so the plot should have 3 axes -- R, G, and B. You'll notice a lot of dots below representing thousands of colors in the original image. The red markers represent the centroids after running K-means. These will be the 16 colors that you will use to compress the image.

# In[52]:


# Plot the colors of the image and mark the centroids
plot_kMeans_RGB(X_img, centroids, idx, K)


# You can visualize the colors at each of the red markers (i.e. the centroids) above with the function below. You will only see these colors when you generate the new image in the next section. The number below each color is its index and these are the numbers you see in the `idx` array.

# Visualize the 16 colors selected

# ### 4.3 Compress the image
# 

# After finding the top $K=16$ colors to represent the image, you can now
# assign each pixel position to its closest centroid using the
# `find_closest_centroids` function. 
# * This allows you to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel. 
# * Notice that you have significantly reduced the number of bits that are required to describe the image. 
#     * The original image required 24 bits (i.e. 8 bits x 3 channels in RGB encoding) for each one of the $128\times128$ pixel locations, resulting in total size of $128 \times 128 \times 24 = 393,216$ bits. 
#     * The new representation requires some overhead storage in form of a dictionary of 16 colors, each of which require 24 bits, but the image itself then only requires 4 bits per pixel location. 
#     * The final number of bits used is therefore $16 \times 24 + 128 \times 128 \times 4 = 65,920$ bits, which corresponds to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6.

# In[54]:


# Find the closest centroid of each pixel
idx = find_closest_centroids(X_img, centroids)

# Replace each pixel with the color of the closest centroid
X_recovered = centroids[idx, :] 

# Reshape image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = np.reshape(X_recovered, original_img.shape) 


# Finally, you can view the effects of the compression by reconstructing
# the image based only on the centroid assignments. 
# * Specifically, you replaced each pixel with the value of the centroid assigned to
# it. 
# * Figure 3 shows a sample reconstruction. Even though the resulting image retains most of the characteristics of the original, you will also see some compression artifacts because of the fewer colors used.
