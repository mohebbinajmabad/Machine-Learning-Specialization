# ## 2 - Recommender Systems <img align="left" src="./images/film_rating.png" style=" width:40px;  " >
# In this lab, you will implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.
# The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors: For each user, a 'parameter vector' that embodies the movie tastes of a user. For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which embodies some description of the movie. The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie.
# 
# The diagram below details how these vectors are learned.

# <figure>
#    <img src="./images/ColabFilterLearn.PNG"  style="width:740px;height:250px;" >
# </figure>

# Existing ratings are provided in matrix form as shown. $Y$ contains ratings; 0.5 to 5 inclusive in 0.5 steps. 0 if the movie has not been rated. $R$ has a 1 where movies have been rated. Movies are in rows, users in columns. Each user has a parameter vector $w^{user}$ and bias. Each movie has a feature vector $x^{movie}$. These vectors are simultaneously learned by using the existing user/movie ratings as training data. One training example is shown above: $\mathbf{w}^{(1)} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(1)} + b^{(1)} = 4$. It is worth noting that the feature vector $x^{movie}$ must satisfy all the users while the user vector $w^{user}$ must satisfy all the movies. This is the source of the name of this approach - all the users collaborate to generate the rating set. 

# <figure>
#    <img src="./images/ColabFilterUse.PNG"  style="width:640px;height:250px;" >
# </figure>

# Once the feature vectors and parameters are learned, they can be used to predict how a user might rate an unrated movie. This is shown in the diagram above. The equation is an example of predicting a rating for user one on movie zero.

# 
# In this exercise, you will implement the function `cofiCostFunc` that computes the collaborative filtering
# objective function. After implementing the objective function, you will use a TensorFlow custom training loop to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering. The first step is to detail the data set and data structures that will be used in the lab.

# <a name="3"></a>
# ## 3 - Movie ratings dataset <img align="left" src="./images/film_rating.png"     style=" width:40px;  " >
# The data set is derived from the [MovieLens "ml-latest-small"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset.   
# [F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1–19:19. <https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872>]
# 
# The original dataset has  9000 movies rated by 600 users. The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The reduced dataset has $n_u = 443$ users, and $n_m= 4778$ movies. 
# 
# Below, you will load the movie dataset into the variables $Y$ and $R$.
# 
# The matrix $Y$ (a  $n_m \times n_u$ matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$. The matrix $R$ is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i,j)=0$ otherwise. 
# 
# Throughout this part of the exercise, you will also be working with the
# matrices, $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{b}$: 
# 
# $$\mathbf{X} = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# --- (\mathbf{x}^{(0)})^T --- \\
# --- (\mathbf{x}^{(1)})^T --- \\
# \vdots \\
# --- (\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)})^T --- \\
# \end{bmatrix} , \quad
# \mathbf{W} = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# --- (\mathbf{w}^{(0)})^T --- \\
# --- (\mathbf{w}^{(1)})^T --- \\
# \vdots \\
# --- (\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)})^T --- \\
# \end{bmatrix},\quad
# \mathbf{ b} = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
#  b^{(0)}  \\
#  b^{(1)} \\
# \vdots \\
# b^{(n_u-1)} \\
# \end{bmatrix}\quad
# $$ 
# 
# The $i$-th row of $\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to the
# feature vector $x^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th movie, and the $j$-th row of
# $\mathbf{W}$ corresponds to one parameter vector $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$, for the
# $j$-th user. Both $x^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ are $n$-dimensional
# vectors. For the purposes of this exercise, you will use $n=10$, and
# therefore, $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ have 10 elements.
# Correspondingly, $\mathbf{X}$ is a
# $n_m \times 10$ matrix and $\mathbf{W}$ is a $n_u \times 10$ matrix.
# 
# We will start by loading the movie ratings dataset to understand the structure of the data.
# We will load $Y$ and $R$ with the movie dataset.  
# We'll also load $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ with pre-computed values. These values will be learned later in the lab, but we'll use pre-computed values to develop the cost model.

# In[2]:


#Load data
X, W, b, num_movies, num_features, num_users = load_precalc_params_small()
Y, R = load_ratings_small()

print("Y", Y.shape, "R", R.shape)
print("X", X.shape)
print("W", W.shape)
print("b", b.shape)
print("num_features", num_features)
print("num_movies",   num_movies)
print("num_users",    num_users)


# In[3]:


#  From the matrix, we can compute statistics like average rating.
tsmean =  np.mean(Y[0, R[0, :].astype(bool)])
print(f"Average rating for movie 1 : {tsmean:0.3f} / 5" )

# ## 4 - Collaborative filtering learning algorithm <img align="left" src="./images/film_filter.png"     style=" width:40px;  " >
# 
# Now, you will begin implementing the collaborative filtering learning
# algorithm. You will start by implementing the objective function. 
# 
# The collaborative filtering algorithm in the setting of movie
# recommendations considers a set of $n$-dimensional parameter vectors
# $\mathbf{x}^{(0)},...,\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)}$, $\mathbf{w}^{(0)},...,\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)}$ and $b^{(0)},...,b^{(n_u-1)}$, where the
# model predicts the rating for movie $i$ by user $j$ as
# $y^{(i,j)} = \mathbf{w}^{(j)}\cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b^{(j)}$ . Given a dataset that consists of
# a set of ratings produced by some users on some movies, you wish to
# learn the parameter vectors $\mathbf{x}^{(0)},...,\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)},
# \mathbf{w}^{(0)},...,\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)}$  and $b^{(0)},...,b^{(n_u-1)}$ that produce the best fit (minimizes
# the squared error).
# 
# You will complete the code in cofiCostFunc to compute the cost
# function for collaborative filtering. 

# 
# <a name="4.1"></a>
# ### 4.1 Collaborative filtering cost function
# 
# The collaborative filtering cost function is given by
# $$J({\mathbf{x}^{(0)},...,\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)},\mathbf{w}^{(0)},b^{(0)},...,\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)},b^{(n_u-1)}})= \left[ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{(i,j):r(i,j)=1}(\mathbf{w}^{(j)} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b^{(j)} - y^{(i,j)})^2 \right]
# + \underbrace{\left[
# \frac{\lambda}{2}
# \sum_{j=0}^{n_u-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(\mathbf{w}^{(j)}_k)^2
# + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{n_m-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(\mathbf{x}_k^{(i)})^2
# \right]}_{regularization}
# \tag{1}$$
# The first summation in (1) is "for all $i$, $j$ where $r(i,j)$ equals $1$" and could be written:
# 
# $$
# = \left[ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{n_u-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n_m-1}r(i,j)*(\mathbf{w}^{(j)} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b^{(j)} - y^{(i,j)})^2 \right]
# +\text{regularization}
# $$
# 
# You should now write cofiCostFunc (collaborative filtering cost function) to return this cost.

# <a name="ex01"></a>
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# **For loop Implementation:**   
# Start by implementing the cost function using for loops.
# Consider developing the cost function in two steps. First, develop the cost function without regularization. A test case that does not include regularization is provided below to test your implementation. Once that is working, add regularization and run the tests that include regularization.  Note that you should be accumulating the cost for user $j$ and movie $i$ only if $R(i,j) = 1$.

# The operations involved in learning $w$, $b$, and $x$ simultaneously do not fall into the typical 'layers' offered in the TensorFlow neural network package.  Consequently, the flow used in Course 2: Model, Compile(), Fit(), Predict(), are not directly applicable. Instead, we can use a custom training loop.

#     
# TensorFlow has the marvelous capability of calculating the derivatives for you. This is shown below. Within the `tf.GradientTape()` section, operations on Tensorflow Variables are tracked. When `tape.gradient()` is later called, it will return the gradient of the loss relative to the tracked variables. The gradients can then be applied to the parameters using an optimizer.

# Below, we compute the ratings for all the movies and users and display the movies that are recommended. These are based on the movies and ratings entered as `my_ratings[]` above.

# In practice, additional information can be utilized to enhance our predictions. Above, the predicted ratings for the first few hundred movies lie in a small range. We can augment the above by selecting from those top movies, movies that have high average ratings and movies with more than 20 ratings. This section uses a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data frame which has many handy sorting features.

# In[16]:


filter=(movieList_df["number of ratings"] > 20)
movieList_df["pred"] = my_predictions
movieList_df = movieList_df.reindex(columns=["pred", "mean rating", "number of ratings", "title"])
movieList_df.loc[ix[:300]].loc[filter].sort_values("mean rating", ascending=False)
